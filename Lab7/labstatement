lab 7 Awk Advanced Features

1) Functions and @include files

write a function called "charcounter()" 
in a file called "lib.awk" to compute 
no. of characters in its argument. (find out a smart way to do this.. e.g. you may
use the readymade length function.)

Now use this function using @include
feature to develop the following two scripts:

 (a) "averageCharPerLine.awk" 
	finds avergae no. of characters per line in a given  input file.

	the script to take one argument, which is input filename, and it should print the 
 value, just the value, and nothing else.

 (b) "charCount.awk" 

 prints just the total no. of chars in the  given input file, and no other message.


2) Sorting keys using sort function

Develop a program "keysorter.awk" as follows:
Read the content of an input file
which contains tab separated
key/value pairs, one pair on each line.

sort the keys (first column)

for example, if input file has:
Amol 	21
Nisha 	22
KG 	11

the output will be printed as
Amol 	
KG	
Nisha	

3) Sorting  values using sort function

Develop "valuesorter.awk" as follows:
Read the content of an input file which
contains tab separated key value pairs on each line.

sort the values (second column)


the output will be printed as

11
21
22

4) Column based sorting

Develop AWK program which is invoked as:

awk -f sort.awk -v SORTKEY=<val> <infile>

the program sorts lines in file <infile>
on the column number given in <val> 
and prints the sorted lines.

5) substring locator

Develop a program "substringlocator.awk" which finds and prints all those
words from a given input file, in which,
a given input substring is embedded
either in the begining or in the end.
Try to use string functions of awk.

Invoke the script as 

awk -f substringlocator.awk -v SUB=<val> <infile>

6) Build an English to Indian
language transliteration program using your own rules. Each rule will match a character
combination pattern and output an
equivalent Indian Language letter
corresponding to this combination.
 
For example

convert

hlo  to हलो

The above was accomplished by mapping
h to ह

l to ल

o to ो

also conjuncts can be produced as follows:

स + ्  + क  gives स्क

We used
http://jrgraphix.net/r/Unicode/0900-097F
which lists unicode tables for various languages

to submit your solution, you will need
to submit your awk converter, and sample
input and output test files named as
"in1", "out1", "in2", "out2" etc.


This assignment will also have an appreciation reward for those who
turn up good converters.

you are free to use output
language as any language of your
choices.
