Lab Today


A) GNUPLOT
B) Work for PROJECT Soft deadline

Both will be submitted on 2 different submission threads.

No extension this time.



A) Make gnuplots for the following with titles, colors. Use your
own data. You can get data from the interent as well e.g. energy
consumption per user per month in 2015, power/price ratio of cpu etc.
Give title to x axis, y axis, and also a title for the whole graph.
Make png output file. Submit png files,gnuplot command files, and the
data files.

	1) one mathematical function without using any data file
	(not those in the demo)
	2) Using 2 column data (x and y values as columns) in a file
	3) Multicolumn data, first one on the x axis, at least 2 columns
		to be plotted on y axis in the same graph
	4) Pie chart
	5) Bar chart
	6) Frequency distribution
	7) Histogram
	8) 3-D plot for an equation without using any data file 
	(e.g. for function a^2+b^2+2 for selected ranges of 
	values of a and b.)
	9) 3-D plot using a data file containing x, y, z values

   This part can be continued from home later and usual extension
   will be given if needed.
   
   submission file structure:
   rollno> 1.plot, 2.plot, 3.plot, 4.plot, 5.plot, 6.plot...9.plot
           2.data, 3.data, 4.data, 5.data, 6.data, 7.data, 9.data
           1.png ..... 9.png
           
           Total: 25 files
   
   Upload whatever you can in the first hour in soft submission thread, and
   continue later. A minimal submission today is required. We expect that
   at least you do 4 or 5 today.
   
B) In the second half, get started on your project. Submit your current code,
and a short file 'FirstSubmission.txt' which includes the items
that you covered so far for your project. (e.g. anything such as 
the code that you wrote, the functionalitis that you decided, 
the interfaces/scripts
 that you could build, testing code that you wrote, pages that you read etc).
 No extension will be given for this part.
