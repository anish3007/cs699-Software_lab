Steps by Arun Babu and TA team
--------------------------------------------------------

0. Take backup of your important data which you cannot
regenerate -- you may lose it during installation
if the steps aren't followed correctly, so be prepared first
with a backup. 

1. Download Ubuntu
    IIT Bombay has its own Ubuntu repository available at its FTP. It contains all Ubuntu versions and official softwares.

    Ubuntu 14.04.2 for 64 Bit PC
 ftp://ftp.iitb.ac.in/distributions/ubuntu/releases/14.04.2/ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso

    Ubuntu 14.04.2 32 Bit PC
 ftp://ftp.iitb.ac.in/distributions/ubuntu/releases/14.04.2/ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-i386.iso

    The file you have downloaded is an ISO image of DVD. You have to create a bootable USB drive to install it in your system.

2. Create a Bootable USB
    Download Universal USB Creater from the following link
 http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/

    Follow the instructions to create a bootable Ubuntu USB

3. Follow the steps of the tutorial in link given below except step 3 as we have done that already for a newer version of ubuntu.

4. If you are stuck at any step, ask your friends who are using linux or TAs for help.

5. After you have installed ubuntu, it is advised to change the software sources to IITB repo as this saves a lot of traffic and gives you faster downloads. To do that Goto Dash -> Software Sources. In the "Download from" drop down, choose ftp.iitb.ac.in. Click close and reload the cache if it prompts. Now all your software downloads will be from IITB repo.
