2. Develop an expression evaluator in file Evaluator.java
which accepts 4 arguments
	a string expression,      leftval,  rightval,    step

and which dumps the list of result values against x values
 after the substitution


e.g 

java Evaluator "x^2+3*x+2" -2 3 1 
would dump:

-2.00 0.00
-1.00 0.00
0.00 2.00
1.00 6.00
2.00 12.00
3.00 20.00 

	
the numbers are of type Double, and while printing, use 2 decimals.	

Grammar for the expression:

operators: ^ * / + -
no brackets
unknown variable: only x		
numbers are positive
integers or double in format 1,2,.. 1.3, 2.22, etc
no spaces in expression


use any algorithm of your choice.

but make use of member functions, appropriate collection data structures
such as ArrayList, Stack, and tokenizers like StringTokenizer.
System.out.format for formatted output.


There can be many classes inside your solution:
 but,
	class Evaluator	 carries main
		we will use this.
	use other classes as your helper classes of your choice


one can use this output to produce a graph plot in gnuplot
