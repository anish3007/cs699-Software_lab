AWK Programs 
use gawk

copy the tarball from

It contains input samples and submission instructions
=====================================================

** bash script is the outer program which receives
input filename and output file name, 
It calls awk scripts *** 

**sample inputs for your reference are given in respective 
directories**


0. Write a program "csv2txt" to convert a comma separated csv spreadsheet
 file into a plain tab separated txt file. 

1. Write a text splitter called 
"txtsplitter" which splits text in the input file such that
after every full stop, a line break is given.

2. Write a text splitter called "formatter" which adds a line
break after every k characters in the file. k is to be given
as argument to formatter.

3. Write a text to latex converter called "txt2texSimple" which
converts a text file into a valid latex file containing just 
this text. 


4. Enhance the converter developed  above to "txt2texWithChapters"
which recognizes Chapter numbers and 
written in the text and converts
them into latex chapters.

Use the file 11.txt as your input file, and make
a good latex out of it, make the pdf and see how
it works.
This has been downloaded from projectgutenberg.org


5. Develop an html to latex converter called "html2tex", 
considering input
similar to the given html file. It has images in it
at the beginning of every chapter, and there are many chapters
in the book.
We are interested in all the text chapters and all the graphics. 
Handle other features if you can, or ignore them. 

6.  Enhance program developed in 4 to include section numbers
and subsection numbers. Call the program "txt2texAdvanced"

use sample text given in the respective directory as your input.


7. Write a program called "grader" to grade students automatically.
Columns represent roll no., marks for quiz1, quiz2, midsem, endsem, project.
The max marks for each are: 20, 20, 50, 100, 15.
The weightages for them are: 10, 10, 15, 50, 15
Ranges for grades are as follows: AA 91 to 100, AB 81 to 90,
and so on for BB, BC, CC, CD and all the rest get DD. 

Output tab separated values of roll no., total, grade.

Now, Add one student entry with roll no. as "Averages", and 
for this student, provide the average in the Total and 
the Grade column.

Similarly add another student entry called "StdDev"
to provide std deviation in column of Total.

Expand the input file sufficiently to test your program
to cover the grade ranges.

Use arrays. 



** For q.no. 5 we will pick up a few best converters and give
them some token of appreciation. ****
