Add the following Latex features in your 
previous file. You may download your submission
from moodle and work on it.

We are not listing what has been covered 
already.

======================================
1. fix the problems discussed in previous
tutorial.

======================================
2. add the following features:

table of content which is automatically
generated!  See 3.tex which contains 
an example. This time we are using
report style as opposed to earlier 
article style.

itemize
enumerate
quote: using begin{quote} end{quote} environment
italics
bold face
subscript 
superscript
overbar
underline
=======================================
3. Add Maths mode formulae and equations

e.g. 5 different types of maths formulae from the given paper on pi formulations

e.g. 5 propositional/first order formulae using various operators
such as conjunction, disjunction, implication, equivalence
forall, there exists- such as those in
the attached documents

use of special symbols such as epsilon, pi, sigma, rho,
alpha, beta, etc.

==========================================

4) scaling up and down your figures

===========================================

5) use bibtex to cite existing literature.
(tutorial added)

note that we are including a bibliography
called myreferences.bib inside our latex
document.

To compile the bib into the document
you have to execute command 
  bibtex 3.tex
which reads the bibtex file as specified
in 3.tex and builds cross references.
After the bibtex you need to compile
using pdflatex once again to see the cross
references inside the pdf.

Add new references of different types
(book, proceeding paper, journal paper)
in your bibtex file, and cross refer
the same in your latex file.


note that bibtex can be a very long file,
and only the references which you use
in latex file appear in the bibliography
section. Try this out.

===========================================

6) practical dia drawing practice

pick any one the attched pics and
draw it cleanly using dia, export,
and include in latex file. scale it
to fit it beautifully.

============================================

Submit all.

 soft deadline  7 pm one submission must
   be done by this time.

 only if needed, extension will be given.

 naming scheme:

 your tar file should be named as follows:

 rollno_assignno.tar.gz

 e.g. if roll no. is 11011000 and assignment
 no. is 3, then submit one single 
 bundle named
 

 11011000_3.gz
 or 11011000_3.zip or
 11011000_3.tar.gz etc.

============================================
